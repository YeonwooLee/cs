# navigation component

The Navigation component consists of three key parts that are described below:

- Navigation graph: An XML resource that contains all navigation-related information in one centralized location. This includes all of the individual content areas within your app, called *destinations*, as well as the possible paths that a user can take through your app.
- `NavHost`: An empty container that displays destinations from your navigation graph. The Navigation component contains a default `NavHost` implementation, [`NavHostFragment`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/navigation/fragment/NavHostFragment), that displays fragment destinations.
- `NavController`: An object that manages app navigation within a `NavHost`. The `NavController` orchestrates the swapping of destination content in the `NavHost` as users move throughout your app.

As you navigate through your app, you tell the `NavController` that you want to navigate either along a specific path in your navigation graph or directly to a specific destination. The `NavController` then shows the appropriate destination in the `NavHost`.

The Navigation component provides a number of other benefits, including the following:

- Handling fragment transactions.
- Handling Up and Back actions correctly by default.
- Providing standardized resources for animations and transitions.
- Implementing and handling deep linking.
- Including Navigation UI patterns, such as navigation drawers and bottom navigation, with minimal additional work.
- [Safe Args](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data#Safe-args) - a Gradle plugin that provides type safety when navigating and passing data between destinations.
- `ViewModel` support - you can scope a `ViewModel` to a navigation graph to share UI-related data between the graph's destinations.

In addition, you can use Android Studio's [Navigation Editor](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) to view and edit your navigation graphs.
